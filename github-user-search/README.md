# GitHub User Search Application

## Overview
The **GitHub User Search Application** is part of the **“Working with APIs”** module.  
In this project, I will build a React-based web application that lets me search for GitHub profiles and view details such as their avatar, bio, and repositories.

Through this project, I will:
- Integrate with the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
- Handle authentication with a personal access token (optional)
- Deploy the application to a web hosting platform

By the end, I will have a fully functional app and a clear understanding of how to work with APIs in a modern React environment.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I will be able to:

1. **Set Up a React Project for API Integration**  
   - Create and configure a new React application  
   - Connect it to the GitHub API to retrieve user data

2. **Develop Basic and Advanced Search Features**  
   - Implement a simple search to display GitHub user information  
   - Add advanced filtering, such as location and repository count

3. **Improve User Interface and Experience**  
   - Use **Tailwind CSS** to design a responsive and visually appealing interface

4. **Deploy the Application**  
   - Publish the app on **Vercel**, making it publicly accessible and production-ready

## Project Outcome
When completed, the application will allow me to:
- Enter a GitHub username to view profile details  
- Apply filters for more specific searches  
- Navigate directly to full GitHub profiles

### Next Steps
1. Set up the React project using Vite  
2. Create the base folder structure (`components/`, `services/`)  
3. Connect to the GitHub API and implement search functionality  
4. Style the interface with Tailwind CSS  
5. Deploy the finished project on Vercel
